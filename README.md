[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AppStateESS/properties.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AppStateESS/properties)

Manages subleases and managed properties.
Due to the university choosing a commercial project (phat paper yall!), this module is deprecated. It contains incompatible NPM packages updated to just silence securit warnings. It will not build. The releases contain old NPM packages with security warnings. Some packages are no longer supported. Use at your own risk.
